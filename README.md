# Coordinate Attention for Efficient Mobile Network Design ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02907))

This repository is a PyTorch implementation of our coordinate attention (will appear in CVPR2021).

Our coordinate attention can be easily plugged into any classic building blocks as a feature representation augmentation tool. Here ([pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)) is a code base that you might want to train a classification model on ImageNet.
